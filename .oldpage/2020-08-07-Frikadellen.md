 <ol><li>Soak the bun in warm water for 10 minutes, then remove the water and press out the bun using your hands, until no more water comes out.</li><li>Place all of the ingredients (except for the breadcrumbs and the oil) in a bowl and knead the mass thoroughly.</li><li>Spread breadcrumbs on a plate.</li><li>Fry one little meatball for checking the taste and adjust as necessary. If you are happy, continue with the rest of the meat:</li><li>Form meatballs the size of a child's fist, roll them in the breadcrumbs and fry at medium heat. Don't use too much heat or you'll burn the outside before the inside is done. You won't be able to fry all of the meatballs in one go, keep enough space in the pan for flipping and arranging them.</li></ol>

 <ul><li>These meatballs are one of the most popular German dishes. They are known as Frikadellen or Buletten, depending on which region of Germany you're in.</li><li>A common side dish is potato salad, or fried potatoes, or boiled potatoes - anything with potatoes really.</li><li>You can also slice them and eat them on bread the next day. Add some pickles, ketchup and/or mustard for an authentic German sandwich.</li><li>The bun can be old and hard since you'll soak it anyway. This is a good way to use up an old bun instead of throwing it away.</li></ul>
