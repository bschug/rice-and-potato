 <h6>Tips</h6>
 <!-- /wp:heading -->
 
 <!-- wp:list -->
 <ul><li>You can use two large Indian mangoes (or whatever else is available in your country). However, keep in mind that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabao_(mango)">the best mango is only on the Philippines</a>!</li><li>The mango should not be over ripe or else you will miss the taste of real sweetness with sourness. It should still be soft though!</li><li>If you are not a fan of sweet you can reduce the condensed milk (remember always taste your mixture or food).</li><li>For the authentic Filipino experience, you should only use Nestle cream and condensed milk. You can substitute them with white sugar or other types of cream, but the taste will be different.</li><li>In Germany, you can find Nestle cream, condensed milk and Graham crackers at the Asian store (you need to be a bit lucky to find the graham crackers and Nestle cream).</li><li>You can use a hand mixer or balloon whisk.</li><li>If you can't find Graham crackers in Germany, you can substitute them with Leibnitz Butterkekse, they're almost the same.</li></ul>
