## Ingredients (for 10 persons)

 - 2 kg predominantly waxy table potatoes
 - 500 ml cream
 - 100 g bacon, cut into little cubes
 - 2 medium-sized white onions
 - 2 cloves of garlic
 - 30 ml vinegar
 - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
 - corn seed oil
 - salt
 - black pepper
 - 1 tsp Maggi seasoning
 - parsley
 
## Procedure

 1. Boil the potatoes for about 40 minutes until they are properly cooked. Quench with cold water, peel, then cut into thick slices (about 1 cm).  
 1. Chop the onions, peel the garlic, cut the bacon into little cubes.
 1. In a large frying pan or wok, heat the oil, then fry the bacon cubes until they're crispy.
 1. Add the onions and press the garlic, then stir fry until the onions are translucent. Make sure not to burn the garlic.
 1. Deglaze with vinegar and balsamico, then reduce for about 1 minute.
 1. Add the cream, season with Maggi, salt and pepper. Keep in mind that this sauce will be a thin layer around the potatoes, so it needs to be salty.
 1. Reduce the sauce for few minutes until the cream forms a skin. Stir and repeat three times. In the meantime, chop the parsley.
 1. In a bowl, combine the potatoes with the sauce and parsley. Be careful not to break the potatoes too much while doing so.
 
## Tips

 - This is the original recipe of my grandma from Saarland.
 - There are hundreds of different styles of potato salad in Germany. This one is objectively the best.
 - The potato salad is best when it's still a bit warm, so try to prepare it about 30 minutes before serving.
 - When boiling the potatoes, check with a fork if the largest potato is done. Depending on the size and type of potato, it may take longer or shorter than 40 minutes.
