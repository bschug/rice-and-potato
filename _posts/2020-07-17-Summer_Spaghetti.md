## Tips

 - This recipe is super fast to make: You can prepare everything in the time it takes for the spaghetti to cook.
 - We recommend Pater Apostolos olive oil from the Mani region of Greece. If you can't get it, you can subsitute it with Kalamata olive oil, or any other olive oil with a strong, spicy flavour.
