## Ingredients (2 portion)

 - 250 g Spaghetti
 - 100 g Parmesan Cheese
 - 8 Cherry Tomatoes
 - 12 leaves of fresh Basil 
 
### For the Sauce

 - 100 ml Olive Oil
 - 30 ml Balsamic Vinegar

## Procedure

 1. Boil the spaghetti in salt water.
 1. While the spaghetti are boiling, peel and press the garlic.
 1. In a bowl, mix the garlic with the oil, Balsamico, oregano and chili flakes.
 1. Grate the parmesan and halve the tomatoes.
 1. When the spaghetti are done, remove them from the water, toss them a few times in the sieve to remove any excess water, then mix them in the bowl together with the sauce.
 1. Add 3/4 of the parmesan to the still-hot spaghetti and stir well to let it melt slightly.
 1. Serve with tomatoes, garnish with basil and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.

## Tips

 - This recipe is super fast to make: You can prepare everything in the time it takes for the spaghetti to cook.
 - We recommend Pater Apostolos olive oil from the Mani region of Greece. If you can't get it, you can subsitute it with Kalamata olive oil, or any other olive oil with a strong, spicy flavour.
