## Ingredients

 - 4 ripe bananas
 - 2 cups flour
 - 1 tsp baking soda
 - 1/4 tsp salt
 - 1/2 cup unsalted butter (melted)
 - 1 cup white sugar
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1 large egg
 - 1 egg yolk (large)
 - 1/4 cup yogurt
 - 1/4 cup walnuts 
 - chocolate chips
 
## Procedure

 1. Mash the bananas in a bowl.
 1. Preheat your oven to 175 degree Celsius.
 1. In a separate bowl, sift all the dry ingredients: flour, salt and baking soda, and mix them.
 1. In a third bowl mix all the wet ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar and vanilla. Then whisk the mixture until well combined, then add the mashed banana and mix it.
 1. Add your dry ingredients to the wet mixture, then fold it until well combined, then add your chocolate chips and nuts.
 1. Bake it for 45 minutes. You can stick a toothpick into the banana bread to see if it's done. If it's clean and no dough sticks to it, that means your banana bread is done.
