## Ingredients

 - 4 ripe __bananas__
 - 2 cups __flour__
 - 1 tsp __baking soda__
 - 1/4 tsp __salt__
 - 1/2 cup unsalted __butter__ (melted)

## Procedure

 1. Mash the bananas in a bowl.
 1. Preheat your oven to 175 degree Celsius.
 1. In a separate bowl, sift all the dry ingredients: flour, salt and baking soda, and mix them.
 1. In a third bowl mix all the wet ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar and vanilla. Then whisk the mixture until well combined, then add the mashed banana and mix it.
 1. Add your dry ingredients to the wet mixture, then fold it until well combined, then add your chocolate chips and nuts.
