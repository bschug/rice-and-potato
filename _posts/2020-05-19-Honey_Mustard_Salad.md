    1. Stir until you have a smooth mixture.
    1. Season to taste with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.

1. Quarter the eggs.
1. Put salad onto a plate, garnish with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and the remaining parmesan.
 
## Tips

 - You may need to run some hot water over the measuring cup - if the honey is too cold, it won't mix well.
 - The water you used for the eggs might be useful for that.
 - You can substitute the corn oil with any neutral oil, e.g. canola oil.
 - For a vegetarian alternative, just leave out the bacon and chicken or replace them with a plant based alternative.
