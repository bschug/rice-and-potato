## Ingredients (2 portions)
 
 - 1 lettuce
 - 2 eggs
 - 75g bacon, small cubes
 - 10 cherry tomatoes
 - 200g chicken filet
 - salt
 - black pepper
 - corn oil
 
### For the Sauce:
 - 4 tsp honey
 - 4 tsp medium spicy mustard
 - 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
 - 2 cloves garlic
 - 50 ml Kalamata olive oil
 - 100-150 ml corn oil

## Procedure

1. Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, season with salt and pepper, then let it rest for 20 minutes.
1. Boil the eggs for 10 minutes.
1. Using a rough grater, grate the carrots and parmesan.
1. Cut the tomatoes in half.
1. Clean, dry and cut the salad.
1. Fry the bacon cubes in oil at medium heat until they're crispy. Keep the oil.
1. Fry the chicken in the oil you used for the bacon.
1. Prepare the sauce in a measuring cup:
    1. Press garlic and add to the measuring cup.
    1. Add honey, mustard, olive oil and corn oil.
    1. Stir until you have a smooth mixture.
    1. Season to taste with balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.
1. Add lettuce, sauce, carrots, bacon and half of the parmesan into a bowl and mix it properly.
1. Quarter the eggs.
1. Put salad onto a plate, garnish with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and the remaining parmesan.
 
## Tips

 - You may need to run some hot water over the measuring cup - if the honey is too cold, it won't mix well.
 - The water you used for the eggs might be useful for that.
 - You can substitute the corn oil with any neutral oil, e.g. canola oil.
