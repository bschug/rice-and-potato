 - __salt__ 
 - __pepper__
 - 2 cups of __oil__
 
### For the Sauce:

## Procedure

 1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized cubes or pieces.
 1. Mix all the ingredients for the marinade, then add the chicken and let it rest for 30 minutes.
 1. For the breading, mix the corn starch, salt and pepper, then add your marinated chicken and coat it well with the breading.
 1. Heat your frying pan with oil until it becomes really hot. Then fry the chicken until it's lightly browned and remove it from the pan. Let it rest for 30 seconds, then fry it again for 2-3 minutes until it's golden brown. This double-frying is the secret for making it really crispy.
 1. Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl, then heat it in a pan at low heat for 1 minute. Dissolve 1 tsp of corn starch in 1 tsp of cold water, then add the mixture into the sauce to thicken it. Heat it for another minute. 
 1. Once the sauce begins to thicken, add your deep fried chicken and cover it with sauce from all sides, then drizzle it with sesame oil and sesame seeds.
 1. Sprinkle with spring onions and serve it.
 
## Tips

 - If you don't have Mirin, you can substitute it with rice wine vinegar and a bit of sugar.
