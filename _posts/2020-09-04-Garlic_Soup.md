## Tips

 - Two bulbs of garlic may seem like too much, but rest assured that the garlic taste is not too strong. If you're a huge fan of garlic, you may want to add even more.
 - Make sure the soup is still hot when you add the cheese, so that it melts nicely.
 - You can substitute the vegetable broth with other broths, e.g. chicken or beef. Even fish stock might work. Experiment and let us know what you like.
