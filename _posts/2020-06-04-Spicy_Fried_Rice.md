## Tips

 - The Chorizo will give the rice a beautiful color.
 - Don't overcook the Chorizo, it burns easily.
 - You don't need to add too much salt and chili, the Chorizo already has plenty of that.
 - You can substitute the Maggi seasoning with soy sauce.
 - If you don't have Champignons, just use your favorite kind of mushrooms.
 - Basmati rice is really good for fried rice because it doesn't stick together.
