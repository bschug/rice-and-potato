## Ingredients (8 portions)

 - 4 tbsp __olive oil__
 - 2 __carrots__
 - 2 __celery__ stalks
 - 2 __onion__
 - 1 kg __minced meat__ (beef and pork)
 - 200 g __bacon__ (small cubes)
 - 250 ml __red wine__
 - 4 tbsp __tomato paste__
 - 1 liter __sieved tomatoes__
 - 4 __bay leaves__
 - 150 ml __milk__
 - __salt__ and __black pepper__ to taste 

## Procedure

 1. Cut carrots, celery, onion and bacon into very small cubes (about 5 mm).
 1. Cook vegetables with olive oil on low heat (4), cover with lid, until onion is translucent.
 1. Add meat and bacon, increase heat to medium (7), fry until meat is browned.
 1. Add wine and reduce until it is mostly evaporated.
 1. Reduce heat to medium/low (5) and add tomato paste, sieved tomatoes, bay leaves and season with salt and pepper.
 1. Cover, reduce heat to low (2) and let it simmer for 4 hours, stirring occasionally.
 1. Remove bay leaves, add the milk.

## Tips

 - Reduce the wine until the liquid is almost completely evaporated. That way, the dish will not contain any alcohol, but will still retain the flavors of the wine.
 - You can also use white wine for a softer taste and lighter color.
 - You can use salsiccia instead of bacon, just peel and crumble the raw sausage before adding.
 - The sauce is still tasty even after being frozen and reheated, so it makes sense to prepare a large batch and freeze the leftovers.
 - Use frying-quality olive oil. Don't waste your expensive extra virgin oil for frying.
