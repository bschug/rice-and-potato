## Ingredients (2 portions)

 - 300 ml __cream__
 - 1 tsp __instant beef stock powder__ (for 300 ml)
 - 50 ml __brandy__
 - 2 __shallots__, diced
 - 30 g (1/2 glass) __pickled green pepper corns__
 - 1 tablespoon __butter__
 - juice of 1/2 __lemon__
 - __salt__ and __black pepper__ to taste

## Procedure

 1. Remove liquid from the green pepper corns and crush them in a mortar and pestle. You don't want to make a paste, but most of the corns should be crushed.
 1. Melt butter in a pan, then fry shallots and pepper corns in it until shallots are translucent.
 1. Add brandy to the pan and reduce until almost all the liquid is gone.
 1. Dissolve the beef stock powder in 100 ml of water and add both it and the cream into the pan.
 1. Let simmer at medium heat until sauce has reached the desired consistency. Stir frequently.
 1. Season with lemon juice, salt and a generous amount of black pepper.

## Tips

 - We are using the amount of beef stock powder that you'd use for 300 ml of beef, but reducing the amount of water we dissolve it in to make the sauce thicken faster.
 - If you reduce the brandy all the way until virtually all the liquid has evaporated, this dish won't contain any alcohol and still retain the rich taste of the brandy.
