## Ingredients (for one person)

 - 3 slices of toast (large)
 - 2 slices of bacon
 - 2 slices of Gouda cheese
 - 1 egg
 - 5-8 tablespoons of butter
 - 1 slice of tomato (large)
 - some fresh lettuce
 - some raw onion rings
 - mayonnaise
 - ketchup
 - barbecue sauce
 - salt
 - black pepper
 
## Procedure

1. Cut out the center from one of the toast slices, such that the crust forms a frame, about 1 cm wide.
1. Prepare tomato slices, onion rings and cheese.
1. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan.
1. Fry the bacon in the butter until crispy, then place on kitchen paper to keep it crispy.
1. Fry one slice of toast in the bacon-butter, from both sides. You may need to add another tablespoon of butter when you turn it.
1. Remove toast from the pan, then add mayonnaise, onion rings and tomato on top, finish with ketchup.
1. Add more butter, then fry the toast frame. Once one side is done, turn it and add the egg in the center. Add some salt and pepper, then place a lid on the pan. Fry at medium heat until the egg white is boiled and the yolk is still liquid. 
1. Carefully remove from the pan and add on top of the previous slice.
1. Add more butter, then fry the center that you cut out earlier from both sides. Add it on top of the egg. Add the bacon on top of that, then the salad.
1. Add more butter, then fry the last slice of toast. Once you've turned it (don't forget to add more butter), add cheese on top and close the pan with a lid until the cheese is melted.
1. Add barbecue sauce on top of the cheese, then add the slice on top of the sandwich, cheese side down.

## Tips

 - The bread below and the lettuce above keep the bacon crispy.
 - You can also use several smaller tomatoes instead of one large slice.
 - Don't be stingy with the butter. The toast soaks it up like a sponge, it will burn if you don't add enough to the pan. The butter also gives this sandwich its irresistible taste.
 - More cheese is obviously always better, but keep in mind that it needs to melt before the toast gets too dark.
 - You should use a transparent lid so that you can see if the egg is done without removing the lid and releasing the heat.
 - This may not be the healthiest food in our collection. You may want to avoid this if you want to lose weight or have a history of cardiovascular diseases. You have been warned!
