 1. Add the onions and fry until they are translucent.
 1. Add the cream and vegetable stock and press the garlic into it. Add about 3/4 of the parmesan cheese. Add the parsley. Season with Maggi, pepper and thyme.
 1. Dissolve the corn starch in a bit of cold water. Stir well to ensure it's doesn't have any clumps, then add to the mushroom cream.
