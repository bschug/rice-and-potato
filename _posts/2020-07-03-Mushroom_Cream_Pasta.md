## Ingredients (for 3 people)

 - 250 g tagliatelle
 - 500 g champignons
 - 3 medium onions
 - 5 cloves of garlic
 - 100 ml olive oil
 - 250 ml cream
 - 100 g Parmigiano Reggiano
 - 250 ml vegetable stock
 - 1 tablespoon corn starch
 - a bunch of parsley
 - 1 tablespoon dried thyme
 - salt
 - black pepper
 - a few drops of Maggi seasoning
 
## Procedure

 1. Cut the mushrooms into halves or quarters, depending on their size. Very large ones may need to cut into thick discs.
 1. Cube the onions and peel the garlic, grate the parmesan and chop the parsley.
 1. Stir fry the mushroom in olive oil under medium-high heat until they are nicely browned. While they are frying, season them with salt.
 1. Add the onions and fry until they are translucent.
 1. Add the cream and vegetable stock and press the garlic into it. Add about 3/4 of the parmesan cheese. Add the parsley. Season with Maggi, pepper and thyme.
 1. Dissolve the corn starch in a bit of cold water. Stir well to ensure it's doesn't have any clumps, then add to the mushroom cream. 
 1. Cook the pasta until it's al dente, then remove it from the water and let it dry for a few minutes, then add it into the sauce.
 1. Transfer onto the plates, sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top.
