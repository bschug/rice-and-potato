## Ingredients (2 portions)

 - 250 g __pasta__ (e.g. Farfalle or Fussili)
 - 250 g __broccoli__
 - 250 g __spinach__ leaves
 - 5 cloves of __garlic__
 - 1 tablespoon __olive oil__
 - 150 g __cream cheese__
 - 75 ml freshly grated __parmigiano reggiano__
 - __salt__, __black pepper__ and __nutmeg__ to taste

## Procedure

 1. Boil the paste in 2 liters of water and 1 tbsp of salt, as per instructions on the packaging. Keep 1 cup of the pasta water for later.
 1. Cut broccoli and spinach into bite-sized pieces.
 1. Cut garlic length-wise into thin slices and fry it in olive oil at medium/low heat (4 or 5) until slightly browned.
 1. Push garlic to the side of the pan where it's less hot, then fry broccoli and spinach for about a minute.
 1. Add cream cheese and half a cup of pasta water, then add the parmigiano and stir until it dissolves. If needed, keep adding pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.
 1. Add pasta and mix well, then season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.

## Tips

 - Works well with frozen spinach. Just defrost it in warm water, then press the liquid out and pull it apart.
