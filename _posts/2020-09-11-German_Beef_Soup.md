## Ingredients (4 portions)

### For the soup:

 - 500 g beef for soup, without bones
 - 3 carrots
 - 1 large onion
 - 1 slice of celeriac
 - 1/2 leek
 - some parsley
 - salt
 - black pepper
 - water
 
### For the dumplings:

 - 2 eggs
 - black pepper
 - generous pinch of nutmeg
 - 1 tablespoon parsley
 - 1 tablespoon instant broth
 - 1/2 tsp Maggi seasoning
 - 1 cup breadcrumbs
 
## Procedure

### First make the soup:

 1. Peel / clean all the vegetables.
 1. Halve the onion, cut the celeriac into 1 cm cubes, cut the leek into thin slices.
 1. Place the meat in a pot, add the vegetables around it, then fill up with water until the meat is fully covered.
 1. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
 1. Slowly heat at medium temperature until the water begins to boil, then reduce to low temperature and let it simmer for 4 hours.
 1. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
 
### Then the dumplings:

 1. Whisk the eggs in a bowl.
 1. Add pepper, nutmeg, parsley, instant broth and Maggi seasoning.
 1. Slowly keep adding breadcrumbs and keep stirring the mass with a fork until it becomes solid enough to form dumplings. Don't add the breadcrumbs too quickly, it takes a minute for them to soak up the liquid.
 1. Remove the meat and carrots from the soup and set them aside, then increase the heat and bring the broth to a boil.
 1. Form little 2 cm balls out of the breadcrumb dough and put them into the boiling broth. After a minute or two, they'll float on top. 
 1. Reduce the temperature again and re-add the meat and carrots.
 
## Tips

 - The beef should have a decent amount of fat to make the soup savory.
